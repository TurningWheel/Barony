#Contributing

Basic guidelines for contributing:
 * Fork the repo.
 * Create a topic branch for your change or addition.
 * Write good commit messages.
 * Please test and self-validate your changes.
 * Submit a pull request.
 * Respond to any feedback and fix any issues that may arise.
 * If any commits have been made upstream, please merge in the upstream changes and resolve any conflicts.


I hope for contributing to be as painless as possible. That said, we need to maintain some sort of standard of quality.
Following the aforementioned contributing guidelines, the coding style guidelines, and refraining from haphazard changes to gameplay balance will increase the likelihood of your pull request being accepted.


###Coding Style Guidelines

I’ve uploaded the coding style guidelines to Google docs: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Wx-tkiNORweFd6htDOn88QG5i4ecyulMGVdXQhxhQnw/edit?usp=sharing


Last of all, thank you for taking an interest in contributing to Barony.
