In general, you are free to copy, modify, distribute, or else use this software however you wish, though any derivative works must also be licensed under the same GPL. Since all of the Barony code will be GPL'd from here on out, that means we will all be able to share and build on each other's work freely.

Note, however, that this open source release of Barony does not include the original game assets, so in order to create a working build of the game from this source, you will also have to supply a legally purchased copy of the original game assets, which are copyrighted by Turning Wheel LLC and may NOT be redistributed (see the original LICENSE.txt text accompanying the original game for details).
