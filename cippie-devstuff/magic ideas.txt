1. More mana put into a spell = stronger effects.
So, need some interface thing to quickly do that, and need to make sure this doesn't get too complicated. Also, more magic makes spell more unstable, thus a bigger chance of failing?

1A. Maybe a spell editor so that you can take a base spell and modify it to your liking. Like pumping more mana into a fireball spell for more damage and bigger blast radius?
