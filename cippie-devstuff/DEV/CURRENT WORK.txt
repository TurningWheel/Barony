AGENDA:
 * Stackdump code for Windows and OSX
 * Controller support.

After that....


Long term:
 * Console ports (PS4 & XBox).
 * Consider OpenAL Port.
 * Consider Direct IP support in a multiplayer steam lobby game, if possible.
 * Summoning magic.
 * NG+? Just, in general, make the game harder and more interesting for veterans.
 * Monster respawn (in NG+)?
 * Multithread pathfinding?
 * Profile the game because performance.
 * More support spells/tactics/strategies/mechanics. Maybe as simple as making support spells more available or cheaper...
 * Summon traps
 * Blindfold use (psychics. Wireframe rendering? Int capstone?)
 * Follower/summon commands: hold position/follow toggle, attack that, change equipment?


 Some time:
 * Magic spells should to damage chests.
 * Option to make right click pop up the context menu, not instant-select.

Things to consider:
 * Keep track of what all language[] entries means so that we don't have magic numbers (e.g. language[1337]) anywhere, but language[entity->lang_entry] instead, or somesuch (e.g. language[GOBLIN_NAME_LANG_ENTRY]).
 * Highlight unidentified items
 * Multithread initial game file/model loading?
 * Male/female monsters reproduce? Maybe hardmode/NG+ only?
 * Deflect magic spells with shield/hitting it with sword? -- whole point of shield of magic resistance
 * Airhorn for Joker.
 * Acid traps
 * Instead of lang/en.txt, lang/en/ is a folder with, ex, lang/en/items.txt
 * Character doll equipment page?
 * "Quickstart" main menu option -- throws you into dungeon level 1, random character customization.


Quick little thingies:
 * None at the moment :)


Bugs?
 * Leadership, right click on angry human. He will swear allegiance to you...despite you trying to murder him a few short moments before.
Or maybe you're just that good...
