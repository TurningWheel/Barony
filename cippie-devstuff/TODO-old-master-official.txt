Some Technical issues / Design goals:

	* Sounds: see Audio.xls
	* Lots of level designing to be done.
	* Art: see Art.xls
	* Textures produced as needed.
	* Split some .c files into more individual files.
	* Item functionality!
	* Finish skills, attributes, RPG system stuff
	* Clean up code.
	* More monsters
	* Monster group thinking; monster ecosystem!
	* Game story cutscenes
	* Slightly more involved character creation process?
	* Complete menu code
	* Four dungeon areas: mine, swamp, sand labyrinth, blue fortress
	* Chests/containers
	* Shops
	* NPCs
	* Theme chests. Most chests spawn with themes; eg food chests, weapons chests, armor chests, scroll chests, spellbook chests, magic chests, potions chests, fighter equipment chest, etc.
	* Chests spawn lower tier items on the first few dungeon levels and spawn better items the deeper you go.
	* quickstart parameter to make debugging much easier. Eg -quickstart=wizard and the game starts in the level with the player already set up as a wizard.
	* "pull the lever"/"wrong lever" puzzle. And methods to figure out which lever is right. (Player can play the game of chance, or they can use their skills/spells/staff of digging/maybe exploration/whatever we can think of)
	* A repeating mechanism signal source. It turns a signal on and off repeatedly on a time interval.
	* Stretch goal of sorts: Replace SDL_Mixer with something more powerful.
	* Add a config option to mute sound when the game loses focus.
	* Book covers
	* Lower intelligence characters can't read books. Instead, a special font is used for them to make everything strange symbols. Or something interesting like that.
	* screenshots/ directory & don't overwrite existing screenshots (maybe replace 0.png 1.png etc with <date>-<time>.png?).
	* Some enhanced editor functionality, such as shift + left clicking to draw a line from the last point you clicked to the new one. (Pending approval)
	* Godmode (for debugging)
	* Summon creatures (enemies & allies) command.
	* /setskill command to set a skill to a certain level.
