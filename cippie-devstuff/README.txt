At the prompting of various persons, I am making publicly available various portions of my notes, TODOs, and various scribbles concerning Barony, from the last few years.
 * Some of this information may be, and is, outdated.
 * Others are various features I want to see at some point in time.
 * Various other files found here are nothing more than an idea that popped into my head which I jotted down somewhere, without dwelling on its practicality.
 * Some of the features or ideas here have already been implemented, either fully or in part. For example, portions of the magic system.


Do note these files are NOT a guarantee of anything that is to come in the future.
I'm releasing these, as is, in the hopes that some might find them either interesting or useful (or, both).
There are features or ideas here which either should not be implemented, or are no longer relevant for varied reasons.
There are also features, modifications, or ideas which I would like to implement at some point in time, but if I don't get around to it -- maybe somebody else would be inspired?


Happy hacking,
