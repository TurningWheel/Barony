# shopkeeper chit-chat

216 They say rings of conflict
create an aura of strife
around a person.#

217 Lamp oil? Rope? Bombs? Dost
thou want it? It is thine my
friend, so long as thou
havest enough rubies!#

218 They say some items are
enchanted with special
magical effects.#

219 Slimes may be found in two
colors. It is said that the
blue ones are stronger.#

220 They say cursed items often
do the opposite of what
they were meant to do.#

221 Trolls ignore thee if thou
keepest thy distance!#

222 Weapons come at different
levels of effectiveness. Wood
and bronze are weak, but steel
is very strong.#

223 The effects of potions wear
off over time.#

224 Beware of picture books. I
knew someone who touched one: the
next thing they knew, they were
all alone on a tiny island.#

225 Thy skills shall improve as
thou makest use of them.#

226 Goblins make good scavengers.
Do not leave powerful items
where they might find them!#

227 I may look weak, but I'm
actually a master of the
mystic arts.#

228 Canned food can make thy
hands greasy. Use a towel to
keep thyself clean.#

229 Thou canst bind wounds
with towels.#

230 Art thou hungry? Rat meat 
is a staple down here.#

231 Scorpion stings can paralyze
thee. Watch out for them.#

232 They say Succubi enjoy trying
to steal mens' clothes.#

233 The older food is, the more
likely it is to make one
sick when eaten.#

234 Mirrors can do odd
things at times.#

235 Try to identify items before
thou makest use of them.#

1415 Once upon a time in a far away land, there stood a town called Hamlet.#

1416

For generations, Hamlet served as a thriving center of commerce for all the
neighboring cities, and the luck of its people was second to none.#

1417




That was, until Baron Herx came to rule the land.#

1418






The Baron, in his endless greed, forced his citizens to dig the surrounding
hills for gold, though the earth had never yielded such treasure before.#

1419









Meanwhile, as the people were forced to work, they schemed to undo their
unjust leader. Eventually, they were able to trick him with a promise of gold
and sealed him within the mines themselves.#

1420













However, in the years that passed since the people of Hamlet did away with
their ruler, things did not go well for the people of the village.#

1421
















In a twist of fate, a variety of monsters began to erupt from the ground
around the town. Some thought it to be Herx exacting his revenge from beyond
the grave, but none could be sure, and eventually, all trade in and out of
town stopped completely.#

1422





















Today, the region of Hamlet is considered cursed, and no one even knows if
the town still exists...#

1423 Victorious, you step into the portal. You know not what to expect, but
are awash with relief. Somehow, you know that the Baron's curse has been
lifted from this land.#

1424



Before you have time to think, you are suddenly standing before the mines
once more. But something is different; the howls of distant monsters have
vanished, and the skies, once a menacing black, are clearing to show the
light of day once again.#

1425








Suddenly, the doors to the mine open wide. Sealed for centuries to contain
the evil within, they swing out from the inside, as a hundred grateful humans
rush out to greet the one who destroyed the Baron.#

1426












The hellish source of the Baron's power remains a mystery to you, and some
deliberation leads you to believe that a visit to the Magician's Guild is in
order for some deeper investigation. But for now, you simply attend to the
merriment of the people you just saved...#

1427 Hacking your way through every demon in your path, you leap through the
portal without a moment's hesitation. Anywhere is better than here - or so
you think.#

1428



Suddenly, you find yourself standing wearily in an endless white hall dotted
with enormous pillars that stretch higher than you can see. Out of
exhaustion, you drop your weapons and step forward.#

1429







Surely, if anything were to happen now you would be finished; yet without
explanation, you suddenly sense power coming back to you. A voice booms out:#

1430










"Greetings, human. We have witnessed your trials and tribulations and we are
infinitely impressed by your fortitude and strength of will. Therefore, we
have a proposition for you..."#

1431














As the voice addresses you, you find yourself either unwilling or unable to
reject what it tells you. Eventually, there is an inexplicable shift in your
mortal being, and you feel yourself fading away...#

1432


















"Evil fades from the mortal world, and its Guardian sleeps. The first age
comes to a close, and the age of chaos begins. Rest now, brave one: your time
will come again."#

2600 Having defeated the Baron and placed his violet orb on the pedestal, you 
step into the portal. Powerful magic sends a tingle over your body, and you are 
transported with a white flash.#

2601





You arrive outside the Hamlet mines and watch the cursed blackness peel away 
from the land. Warm sunlight flows over the countryside. As the doors of the 
mine open wide, people carefully spread into the streets, acclimating to 
their freedom.#

2602










You march to the Magician's Guild for answers about Herx's power, but the 
doorman there turns you away. 

Seeing you haggard from your quest, he encourages you to take a rest. 
"The answers you seek will still be here after you recover."#

2603
















You turn back to the streets and find a hundred people waiting for you, their
hero. You join them in well-earned revelry, but resolve to revisit the 
Magicians' Guild once the merriment dies down.#

2604






















Now advance when you and your allies are ready!#

2605






















Now wait for your leader to advance onward...#

2606 Click to continue.#

2607 Through the portal, a weak magic tugs you from the Citadel. Your feet 
hover over the floor as it shakes violently. Pipes and pistons crash down 
in a muffled racket. You have a detached sense of peace, and a moment to 
ponder what has occurred.#

2608 







The lich siblings join the Baron in death, voiding their deals done with 
devils.#
2609 












Is it for the best that you escaped death here? Through your trials, you've
earned power greater than they, their shattered remains proving it.#

2610 You open your eyes, standing in The Magician's Guild with a wizard and bishop. 
Their faces relax in relief.#

2611 



In the following days, you work with them in secrecy to prevent the realms of
hell from stepping foot in Hamlet again using the artifacts underground.#

2612 








Hamlet begins its ascent toward its former glory. The guilds unite under your 
banner to clear out the straggling monsters and rebuild the city. The citizens 
beg you to take the Baron's court and rule.#


2613














You vow to keep the hellish source of the liches' power secret, to prevent 
anyone seeking that power again, deep underground. #

2614 Power you know will always be waiting.#

# Orpheus and Erudyce chatter.
2615 "Brother, I sense someone has arrived. Shall we greet them?"#
2616 "No, we are too busy for formalities."#

2617 "Sister, did you invite company?"#
2618 "No, the Guild sent them."#
2619 "Hm."#

2620 "Sister, the Cave entrance is still sealed, is it not?"#
2621 "It is. Why do you ask?"#
2622 "Nevermind. It's nothing."#

2623 "Is the Minotaur necessary, Brother?"#
2624 "No, sister, but I do like the show."#

2625 "Do you think, Sister, they'll flee from the Minotaur?"#
2626 "I don't care, Brother. Send it anyway."#

2627 "This Minotaur has been moping about ever since Herx died."#
2628 "Send it away if it bothers you so much, Sister."#

# Caves chatter.
2629 "Brother, somebody's making their way through the Caves."#
2630 "Are you concerned?"#
2631 "Mmm. No."#

2632 "The Kobolds guaranteed us better results in the Caves."#
2633 "Don't worry, brother. There's still a ways to go, they may yet deliver."#

2634 "Brother, I admit, I wish they'd hurry."#
2635 "It would make things simpler, wouldn't it?"#

# Caves transition.
2636 "Herx couldn't handle the power he found. We tried to warn him."#
2637 "His death was inevitable."#
2652 "Our uninvited guests are nothing but commoners."#

# Citadel chatter.
2638 "This is all wrong. We created this place for immortals."#
2639 "Immortals and their servants, Sister."#
2653 "Let them come."#

2640 "How much longer must I wait around?"#
2641 "Go about your business, brother. There isn't much to prepare."#

2642 "You were right to exclude the rest of the guild from our plans here, Brother."#
2643 "Small minds always have small ambitions."#

# Endgame.
2644 "Our access to power has only increased since you removed Herx."#
2645 "Allow us to thank you for giving his Barony over to us."#
