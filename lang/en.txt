# shopkeeper chit-chat

216 They say rings of conflict
create an aura of strife
around a person.#

217 Lamp oil? Rope? Bombs? Dost
thou want it? It is thine my
friend, so long as thou
havest enough rubies!#

218 They say some items are
enchanted with special
magical effects.#

219 Slimes may be found in two
colors. It is said that the
blue ones are stronger.#

220 They say cursed items often
do the opposite of what they
were meant to do.#

221 Trolls ignore thee if thou
keepest thy distance!#

222 Weapons come at different
levels of effectiveness. Wood
and bronze are weak, but
steel is very strong.#

223 The effects of potions wear
off over time.#

224 Beware of picture books.
I knew a person who touched
one and, suddenly, they were
all alone on a tiny island.#

225 Thy skills shall improve as
thou makest use of them.#

226 Goblins make good
scavengers. Do not leave
powerful items where they
might find them!#

227 I may look weak, but I'm
actually a master of the
mystic arts.#

228 Canned food can make thy
hands greasy. Use a towel to
keep thyself clean.#

229 Thou canst bind wounds with
towels.#

230 Art thou hungry? Rat meat
is a staple down here.#

231 Scorpion stings can paralyze
thee. Watch out for them.#

232 They say Succubi enjoy
trying to steal peoples'
clothes.#

233 The older food is, the more
likely it is to make one sick
when eaten.#

234 Mirrors can do odd things at
times.#

235 Try to identify items before
thou makest use of them.#

1415 Once upon a time in a far away land, there stood a town called Hamlet.#

1416

For generations, Hamlet served as a thriving center of commerce for all the
neighboring cities, and the luck of its people was second to none.#

1417




That was, until Baron Herx came to rule the land.#

1418






The Baron, in his endless greed, forced his citizens to dig the surrounding
hills for gold, though the earth had never yielded such treasure before.#

1419









Meanwhile, as the people were forced to work, they schemed to undo their
unjust leader. Eventually, they were able to trick him with a promise of gold
and sealed him within the mines themselves.#

1420













However, in the years that passed since the people of Hamlet did away with
their ruler, things did not go well for the people of the village.#

1421
















In a twist of fate, a variety of monsters began to erupt from the ground
around the town. Some thought it to be Herx exacting his revenge from beyond
the grave, but none could be sure, and eventually, all trade in and out of
town stopped completely.#

1422





















Today, the region of Hamlet is considered cursed, and no one even knows if
the town still exists...#

1423 Victorious, you step into the portal. You know not what to expect, but
are awash with relief. Somehow, you know that the Baron's curse has been
lifted from this land.#

1424





Before you have time to think, you are suddenly standing before the mines
once more. But something is different; the howls of distant monsters have
vanished, and the skies, once a menacing black, are clearing to show the
light of day once again.#

1425











Suddenly, the doors to the mine open wide. Sealed for centuries to contain
the evil within, they swing out from the inside, as a hundred grateful humans
rush out to greet the one who destroyed the Baron.#

1426
















The hellish source of the Baron's power remains a mystery to you, and some
deliberation leads you to believe that a visit to the Magician's Guild is in
order for some deeper investigation. But for now, you simply attend to the
merriment of the people you just saved...#

1427 


Hacking your way through every demon in your path, you leap through the
portal without a moment's hesitation. Anywhere is better than here - or so
you think.#

1428




Suddenly, you find yourself standing wearily in an endless white hall dotted
with enormous pillars that stretch higher than you can see. Out of
exhaustion, you drop your weapons and step forward.#

1429









Surely, if anything were to happen now you would be finished; yet without
explanation, you suddenly sense power coming back to you. A voice booms out:#

1430












"Greetings, human. We have witnessed your trials and tribulations and we are
infinitely impressed by your fortitude and strength of will. Therefore, we
have a proposition for you..."#

1431

















As the voice addresses you, you find yourself either unwilling or unable to
reject what it tells you. Eventually, there is an inexplicable shift in your
mortal being, and you feel yourself fading away...#

1432





















"Evil fades from the mortal world, and its Guardian sleeps. The first age
comes to a close, and the age of chaos begins. Rest now, brave one: your time
will come again."#

2600 Having defeated the Baron and placed his violet orb on the pedestal, you 
step into the portal. Powerful magic sends a tingle over your body, and you are 
transported with a white flash.#

2601





You arrive outside the Hamlet mines and watch the cursed blackness peel away 
from the land. Warm sunlight flows over the countryside. As the doors of the 
mine open wide, people carefully spread into the streets, acclimating to 
their freedom.#

2602










You march to the Magician's Guild for answers about Herx's power, but the 
doorman there turns you away. 

Seeing you haggard from your quest, he encourages you to take a rest. 
"The answers you seek will still be here after you recover."#

2603

















You turn back to the streets and find a hundred people waiting for you, their
hero. You join them in well-earned revelry, but resolve to revisit the 
Magicians' Guild once the merriment dies down.#

2604






















Now advance when you and your allies are ready!#

2605






















Now wait for your leader to advance onward...#

2606 Click to continue.#

2607 Through the portal, a weak magic tugs you from the Citadel. Your feet 
hover over the floor as it shakes violently. Pipes and pistons crash down 
in a muffled racket. You have a detached sense of peace, and a moment to 
ponder what has occurred.#

2608 







The lich siblings join the Baron in death, voiding their deals done with 
devils.#
2609 












Is it for the best that you escaped death here? Through your trials, you've
earned power greater than they, their shattered remains proving it.#

2610 You open your eyes, standing in The Magician's Guild with a wizard and bishop. 
Their faces relax in relief.#

2611 



In the following days, you work with them in secrecy to prevent the realms of
hell from stepping foot in Hamlet again using the artifacts underground.#

2612 








Hamlet begins its ascent toward its former glory. The guilds unite under your 
banner to clear out the straggling monsters and rebuild the city. The citizens 
beg you to take the Baron's court and rule.#


2613














You vow to keep the hellish source of the liches' power secret, to prevent 
anyone seeking that power again, deep underground. #

2614 Power you know will always be waiting.#

# Orpheus and Erudyce chatter.
2615 "Brother, I sense someone has arrived. Shall we greet them?"#
2616 "No, we are too busy for formalities."#

2617 "Sister, did you invite company?"#
2618 "No, the Guild sent them."#
2619 "Hm."#

2620 "Sister, the Cave entrance is still sealed, is it not?"#
2621 "It is. Why do you ask?"#
2622 "Nevermind. It's nothing."#

2623 "Is the Minotaur necessary, Brother?"#
2624 "No, sister, but I do like the show."#

2625 "Do you think, Sister, they'll flee from the Minotaur?"#
2626 "I don't care, Brother. Send it anyway."#

2627 "This Minotaur has been moping about ever since Herx died."#
2628 "Send it away if it bothers you so much, Sister."#

# Caves chatter.
2629 "Brother, somebody's making their way through the Caves."#
2630 "Are you concerned?"#
2631 "Mmm. No."#

2632 "The Kobolds guaranteed us better results in the Caves."#
2633 "Don't worry, brother. There's still a ways to go, they may yet deliver."#

2634 "Brother, I admit, I wish they'd hurry."#
2635 "It would make things simpler, wouldn't it?"#

# Caves transition.
2636 "Herx couldn't handle the power he found. We tried to warn him."#
2637 "His death was inevitable."#
2652 "Our uninvited guests are nothing but commoners."#

# Citadel chatter.
2638 "This is all wrong. We created this place for immortals."#
2639 "Immortals and their servants, Sister."#
2653 "Let them come."#

2640 "How much longer must I wait around?"#
2641 "Go about your business, brother. There isn't much to prepare."#

2642 "You were right to exclude the rest of the guild from our plans here, Brother."#
2643 "Small minds always have small ambitions."#

# Endgame.
2644 "Our access to power has only increased since you removed Herx."#
2645 "Allow us to thank you for giving his Barony over to us."#

# Orpheus death.
2646 "Impossible!!!"#
2647 "Pest, I will use your soul to undo this offense!"#

# Erudyce death.
2648 "Curse you!!!"#
2649 "Big mistake, cretin. Time to suffer."#

# Orpheus giggles.
2650 "Ah ha ha ha ha ha haah!!"#
# Erudyce giggles.
2651 "Ah ha ha ha ha ha ha hah haah!"#

 You are quite the party animal, %s. I couldn't keep up with you!#

 Are you sure you got enough rest, %s?#
2703 The %s
 First you defeat the Baron, and you still out-party a joker like me!#

 You're going to take it easy now, though, right %s?#

 Everyone came back to their shops, like nothing happened.#
2712 The %s
 Hamlet's Shopkeepers are tougher after surviving the Baron's dungeon.#

2721 The %s
 How could I ever thank you %s? *hic!*#
2722 The %s
 I love you, man. Like, seriously, %s, I love you. *hic!*#

2731 %s
 It's a secret to everybody.#
2732 %s
 This used to be the foyer to the Baron's mansion.#
2733 %s
 We're remodeling the interior for our next ruler.#
2734 %s
 We want to forget all about Herx.#
2735 %s
 It's a secret to everybody.#
2736 %s
 ...#

2740 type:seq#
2741 The %s
 I tried to get into the Crystal Caves, but a barrier stopped me.#
2742 The %s
 Perhaps the Magician's Guild erected that barrier.#
2743 The %s
 I'm from a distant city, and a member of the Hunter's Guild.#
2744 The %s
 Hamlet's Hunters' Guild isn't in this district.#
2745 The %s
 I guess Magicians and Hunters don't get along so well.#
2746 The %s
 Hunters kill bad guys. Sometimes they're Magicians.#
2747 The %s
 No grudges, just don't be a bad guy!#
2748 The %s
 ...#

2750 type:rand#
2751 The %s
 Is it strange that I am tempted to go back into the mine?#
2752 The %s
 The sky out here is so large. I'm scared.#
2753 The %s
 The mines, Herx's dungeon, is on the other side of this gate.#
2754 The %s
 Maybe I'll just go back for a little while.#

2760 type:seq#
2761 The %s
 The Magician's Guild must be up to something.#
2762 The %s
 Guilds always have too many secrets.#
2763 The %s
 I heard that Merlin and the Magician's Guild had a falling out.#
2764 The %s
 I bet Herx is in tight with Archmagisters Orpheus and Erudyce.#
2765 The %s
 Don't get me started on the Hunters' Guild.#
2766 The %s
 I heard the Masons Guild works for the Church.#
2767 The %s
 The Church has secrets, but they also help the poor.#
2768 The %s
 Is the Church a Guild? Asking for a friend.#
2769 The %s
 ...#

2770 type:seq#
2771 The %s
 Welcome back, %s. I hope you're rested.#
2772 The %s
 The magicians inside can explain everything.#
2773 The %s
 Me? No I'm just a doorman.#
2774 The %s
 Many come and go, %s. No membership required.#
2775 The %s
 Merlin used to come by a lot, but then he just stopped.#
2776 The %s
 Come to think of it, Herx used to come by regularly.#
2777 The %s
 Herx would always leave angry after every visit.#
2778 The %s
 I wish I could've seen Herx's face when you showed up...#
2779 The %s
 ...#

2780 type:seq#
2781 The %s
 The Baron wanted to set up the mine in the Crystal Caves.#
2782 The %s
 The Archmagisters refused to allow Herx to mine there.#
2783 The %s
 Herx offered a lot of grants to the Magicians' Guild.#
2784 The %s
 I think Herx expected favors from the Archmagisters.#
2785 The %s
 Eventually Herx gave up on getting the help of the Guild.#
2786 The %s
 Things turned out bad, but they could've been worse.#
2787 The %s
 ...#

2790 type:seq#
2791 The %s
 Merlin told us about the dangerous magic Herx found.#
2792 The %s
 We never heard from Merlin again after he left to stop Herx.#
2793 The %s
 I heard rumors about a new letter from Merlin, but I never saw it.#
2794 The %s
 You know, Merlin was never an official member of the Magicians Guild.#
2795 The %s
 Some people just need their independence. I respect that.#
2796 The %s
 ...#

2800 type:seq#
2801 The %s
 After Herx was locked away, the Archmagisters went to the Crystal Caves.#
2802 The %s
 I guess they wanted to see what all the fuss was about.#
2803 The %s
 If it wasn't for the Archmagisters, Herx would've built an army here.#
2804 The %s
 We never would've been able to figure out how to lock Herx away. #
2805 The %s
 I think Erudyce and Orpheus knew sealing up Herx wouldn't be enough.#
2806 The %s
 ...#

2810 type:seq#
2811 The %s
 Powerful monsters started coming from the Crystal Caves.#
2812 The %s
 The Guild had to seal the Caves to keep Hamlet from being destroyed.#
2813 The %s
 I hope that the Archmagisters inside are alright.#
2814 The %s
 I really hope those monsters have nothing to do with their research.#
2815 The %s
 Orpheus is so driven. Nothing can stop him.#
2816 The %s
 Erudyce likes to influence things from behind the scenes.#
2817 The %s
 ...#

2820 type:seq#
2821 The %s
 I sensed power from the orb when you put it on that pedestal.#
2822 The %s
 I wonder why Herx didn't use that power to escape the dungeon.#
2823 The %s
 I was able to trap some of the power that Herx's orb released.#
2824 The %s
 This portal pierces the seal to the Caves using the power of the orb.#
2825 The %s
 Archmagisters Orpheus and Erudyce will help return things to normal.#
2826 The %s
 They must have learned something about the power Herx found.#
2827 The %s
 ...#

2830 type:seq#
2831 %s
 Don't worry %s, I know who you are.#
2832 %s
 I wanted to meet you before you left town.#
2833 %s
 Me? I am one of the esteemed members of the Merchant's guild.#
2834 %s
 I'm only interested in the rarest of
 artifacts in the land.              
 In particular, the Magician's orbs that were stolen by Herx.#
2835 %s
 If you happened to retrieve any of 
 them, I'd be willing to part with one of my prized possessions in return.#
2836 %s
 You see, a high ranking guild member
 such as myself can extort those mages 
 for every penny they own with their 
 precious orbs!#
2837 %s
 I know you have too much of a heart to do the same yourself.#
2838 %s
 So it is up to you.                
 Leave them with me and we'll say no 
 more about our little encounter.#

3771 You arrive outside the Hamlet mines and watch the cursed blackness peel away
from the land. Warm sunlight flows over the countryside. As the doors of the
mine open wide, people carefully spread into the streets, acclimating to
their freedom.#
3772 





You rush to nearby buildings, looking for a place to hide and figure out your
next move. There are too many humans and the sun is too bright for your liking.#
3773 








You break your way into what appears to be an inn. You spend the night under
the sheets of a comfortable bed while the sounds of revelry surround you.#
3774 













Luckily you avoid detection. As humans party through the hostel you hear of
a power even greater than Herx's, said to be held in the Magician's Guild.#
3775 


















A trapdoor in the bunkroom leads to a sewer. You wait for the humans to leave.#

3776 Hacking your way through every demon in your path, you leap through the
portal without a moment's hesitation. No entity, mortal or immortal, can
challenge your power.#
3777 



Suddenly, you find yourself standing wearily in an endless white hall dotted
with enormous pillars that stretch higher than you can see. The smell of
blood is thick on your breath, but you suspect more will need to be spilled.#
3778 








Can this supernatural place compete with Minotaurs, Demons; Baphomet himself?
You sense a great magic flow into the room. You are unnerved. A voice booms:#
3779 











"We have witnessed your strength and lust for power. You were not expected here.
We are however impressed by your ferocity and focus. We ask you consider this
proposition, mighty one..."#
3780 
















As the voice addresses you, you find you are tempted by its words. It speaks
of a power greater than Herx, or Baphomet. It claims that it is greater than
you. The prospect of a competitor shall not stand.#
3781 




















You find yourself standing inside a Hamlet inn, its denizens too drunk or 
weary to notice you at first. You steal yourself into a backroom; a trapdoor
leads to a sewer. A great magic from beyond there beckons you.#

3782 Hacking your way through every demon in your path, you leap through the
portal without a moment's hesitation. No entity, mortal or immortal, can
challenge your power.#
3783 



Suddenly, you find yourself standing wearily in an endless white hall dotted
with enormous pillars that stretch higher than you can see. Have you not
defeated the source of Herx's vile power? You wonder what danger now awaits.#
3784 








A sense of peace overwhelms and refreshes you. You know that Herx's power has
been removed. But Baphomet was just one devil. A voice comforts you:#
3785 











"The lich Herx has become dust, but cleverer foes draw upon hellish evil.
Hamlet is free for now, but the world is not safe. In times such as these
a mighty one must tip the scales. We have a proposition for you..."#
3786 
















As the voice addresses you, you find yourself either unwilling or unable to
reject what it tells you. You find your physical form shifting back into the
mortal realm. "You must sever evil from Hamlet or there will be no peace."#
3787 




















With renewed courage, you find yourself standing in Hamlet. Evidence of a
massive party flows from the gates of the mines, now open, to a nearby hostel.
You know the Magician's Guild will aid you in your quest.#

3788 Victorious, you step into the portal. You know not what to expect, but 
are awash with delight. You expect that the source of the Baron's power 
is now within your reach.#

3789 




Before you have time to think, you are suddenly standing before the mines 
once more. But something is different; the seductive power you sensed here 
is further away. The black skies are clearing to show the light of day.#

3790 









Suddenly, the doors to the mine open wide. Sealed for centuries to contain 
the evil within, they swing out from the inside, as a hundred grateful humans 
rush out. It appears the Baron's power slipped through your grasp.#

3791 














The hellish source of that dark power remains a mystery to you, and some
eavedropping from the shadows leads you to believe that the Magician's Guild
may have a lead on some dark magic. For now, you resolve to leave this land
and return another time to exploit the secrets of Hamlet.#

3792 Hacking your way through every demon in your path, you leap through the
portal without a moment's hesitation. It seems no entity, mortal or 
immortal, can challenge your power.#
3793 



Suddenly, you find yourself standing wearily in an endless white hall dotted
with enormous pillars that stretch higher than you can see. The smell of
blood is thick on your breath, but you suspect more will need to be spilled.#
3794 








Can this supernatural place compete with Minotaurs, Demons; Baphomet himself?
You sense a great magic flow into the room. You are unnerved. A voice booms:#
3795 











"We have witnessed your strength and lust for power. You were not expected here.
We are however impressed by your ferocity and focus. We ask you consider this
proposition, mighty one..."#
3796 
















As the voice addresses you, you find yourself either unwilling or unable to
reject what it tells you. Eventually, there is an inexplicable shift in your
physical being, and you feel yourself fading away...#
3797 




















You sense the supreme power of a great mind as you fade from the mortal world. 
The first age comes to a close, and the age of chaos begins. You are sure that
your time is emminent and your purpose will be fulfilled.#

3798 Through the portal, a weak magic tugs you from the Citadel. Your feet 
hover over the floor as it shakes violently. Pipes and pistons crash down 
in a muffled racket. Your inputs are dulled and you observe the transferrence
of your consciousness.#
3799 







It seems demonic evil has been destroyed, at least, as far as Hamlet knows.#
3800 












You consider its citizens are lucky to have you. They could not have survived
without you, but alas, you would never have been invented without them.#
3801 Your systems are nominal. You stand with a wizard and bishop. Their
faces open into expressions of surprise.#
3802 



They are shocked to see that a humble slave, a servant... an automaton has
rescued them from supernatural evil. Is your inhuman nature the reason?#
3803 








The guilds and the churches agree, there is no more perfect arbiter for the
well being of humans. You are entrusted with the tasks of law, assumed to
have perfect objectivity as the new Baron. Your rulings are infallible.#
3804 













But is that so? What is it that makes you conscious? You lead Hamlet to
its former glory. But you think some problems may require more power.#
3805 Through the portal, a weak magic tugs you from the Citadel. Your feet 
hover over the floor as it shakes violently. Pipes and pistons crash down 
in a muffled racket. You clench your eyes knowing magic holds you tight.
You grimly await what it offers.#
3806 







If the liches gained their powers from devils, what does that make you
who ended them? Is it now yours to bear? What use was it to them?#
3807 












It seems you got what you came here for, though not in the way you
anticipated. Power cannot just be held, it must be used.#
3808 You open your eyes and find yourself standing with two mortals. 
They cower in your presence. You command them to bow before you.#
3809 



Through demonic magic, you bind their souls hostage in servitude, using
their influence to bend factions to your secret purpose.#
3810 








The following years are not easy for the surface world. Eventually they learn
that joy and glory is found in strength. You slaughter all who oppose you.
Eventually they embrace your nature. The humans bear your banner.#
3811 













Can any empire challenge what you've built? Prophets teach that the
human spirit is stronger than anything. You fear that power is real.#

3812 Through the portal, a weak magic tugs you from the Citadel. Your feet 
hover over the floor as it shakes violently. Pipes and pistons crash down
in a muffled racket. You try to shake your terror and close your eyes.#
3813 







What have you to be afraid of? You have defeated mighty, evil masters.
Who can challenge your people now?#
3814 












You fear nothing. No, it is others who should fear you. A moment of clarity
causes you to wonder if fear is what you want from others.#

3815 You open your eyes, standing in The Magician's Guild with a wizard and bishop. 
Their faces are confused, but they await your reaction with patient wonder.#
3816 



You suspect things may've gone differently if wiser men had not awaited you.
They recognized your heroism and offered gratitude for your deeds. Are these
the same people who murdered your kind so recently?#
3817 









Though shaky at first, your peoples build an alliance toward peace.#
3818 













Through your example, insectoids, humans, goatmen and goblins embrace courage
instead of fear. Trade prospers in Hamlet as people belay their lust for power.#
