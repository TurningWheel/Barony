# shopkeeper chit-chat

216 They say rings of conflict
create an aura of strife around a
person.#

217 Lamp oil? Rope? Bombs? Dost
thou want it? It is thine my
friend, so long as thou havest
enough rubies!#

218 They say some items are
enchanted with special magical
effects.#

219 Slimes may be found in two
colors. It is said that the blue
ones are stronger.#

220 They say cursed items often do
the opposite of what they were
meant to do.#

221 Trolls ignore thee if thou
keepest thy distance!#

222 Weapons come at different
levels of effectiveness. Wood and
bronze are weak, but steel is very
strong.#

223 The effects of potions wear
off over time.#

224 Beware of picture books. I
knew someone who touched one: the
next thing they knew, they were
all alone on a tiny island.#

225 Thy skills shall improve as
thou makest use of them.#

226 Goblins make good scavengers.
Do not leave powerful items where
they might find them!#

227 I may look weak, but I'm
actually a master of the mystic
arts.#

228 Canned food can make thy hands
greasy. Use a towel to keep
thyself clean.#

229 Thou canst bind wounds with
towels.#

230 Art thou hungry? Rat meat is a
staple down here.#

231 Scorpion stings can paralyze
thee. Watch out for them.#

232 They say Succubi enjoy trying
to steal mens' clothes.#

233 The older food is, the more
likely it is to make one sick when
eaten.#

234 Mirrors can do odd things at
times.#

235 Try to identify items before
thou makest use of them.#

1415 Once upon a time in a far away land, there stood a town called Hamlet.#

1416

For generations, Hamlet served as a thriving center of commerce for all the
neighboring cities, and the luck of its people was second to none.#

1417




That was, until Baron Herx came to rule the land.#

1418






The Baron, in his endless greed, forced his citizens to dig the surrounding
hills for gold, though the earth had never yielded such treasure before.#

1419









Meanwhile, as the people were forced to work, they schemed to undo their
unjust leader. Eventually, they were able to trick him with a promise of gold
and sealed him within the mines themselves.#

1420













However, in the years that passed since the people of Hamlet did away with
their ruler, things did not go well for the people of the village.#

1421
















In a twist of fate, a variety of monsters began to erupt from the ground
around the town. Some thought it to be Herx exacting his revenge from beyond
the grave, but none could be sure, and eventually, all trade in and out of
town stopped completely.#

1422





















Today, the region of Hamlet is considered cursed, and no one even knows if
the town still exists...#

1423 Victorious, you step into the portal. You know not what to expect, but
are awash with relief. Somehow, you know that the Baron's curse has been
lifted from this land.#

1424



Before you have time to think, you are suddenly standing before the mines
once more. But something is different; the howls of distant monsters have
vanished, and the skies, once a menacing black, are clearing to show the
light of day once again.#

1425








Suddenly, the doors to the mine open wide. Sealed for centuries to contain
the evil within, they swing out from the inside, as a hundred grateful humans
rush out to greet the one who destroyed the Baron.#

1426












The hellish source of the Baron's power remains a mystery to you, and some
deliberation leads you to believe that a visit to the Magician's Guild is in
order for some deeper investigation. But for now, you simply attend to the
merriment of the people you just saved...#

1427 Hacking your way through every demon in your path, you leap through the
portal without a moment's hesitation. Anywhere is better than here - or so
you think.#

1428



Suddenly, you find yourself standing wearily in an endless white hall dotted
with enormous pillars that stretch higher than you can see. Out of
exhaustion, you drop your weapons and step forward.#

1429







Surely, if anything were to happen now you would be finished; yet without
explanation, you suddenly sense power coming back to you. A voice booms out:#

1430










"Greetings, human. We have witnessed your trials and tribulations and we are
infinitely impressed by your fortitude and strength of will. Therefore, we
have a proposition for you..."#

1431














As the voice addresses you, you find yourself either unwilling or unable to
reject what it tells you. Eventually, there is an inexplicable shift in your
mortal being, and you feel yourself fading away...#

1432


















"Evil fades from the mortal world, and its Guardian sleeps. The first age
comes to a close, and the age of chaos begins. Rest now, brave one: your time
will come again."#
