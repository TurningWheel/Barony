# shopkeeper chit-chat

216 They say rings of conflict
create an aura of strife
around a person.#

217 Lamp oil? Rope? Bombs? Dost
thou want it? It is thine, my
friend, so long as thou
hast enough rubies!#

218 They say some items are
enchanted with special
magical effects.#

219 Slimes may be found in two
colors. It is said that the
blue ones are stronger.#

220 They say cursed items often
do the opposite of what they
were meant to do.#

221 Trolls ignore thee if thou
keepest thy distance!#

222 Weapons come at different
levels of effectiveness. Wood
and bronze are weak, but
steel is very strong.#

223 The effects of potions wear
off over time.#

224 Beware of picture books.
I knew a person who touched
one, and suddenly, they were
all alone on a tiny island.#

225 Thy skills shall improve as
thou makest use of them.#

226 Goblins make good
scavengers. Do not leave
powerful items where they
might find them!#

227 I may look weak, but I'm
actually a master of the
mystic arts.#

228 Canned food can make thy
hands greasy. Use a towel to
keep thyself clean.#

229 Thou canst bind wounds with
towels.#

230 Art thou hungry? Rat meat
is a staple down here.#

231 Scorpion stings can paralyze
thee. Watch out for them.#

232 They say Succubi enjoy
trying to steal peoples'
clothes.#

233 The older food is, the more
likely it is to make one sick
when eaten.#

234 Mirrors can do odd things at
times.#

235 Try to identify items before
thou makest use of them.#

2618 "No, the Guild sent them."#
2619 "Hm."#

2620 "Sister, the Cave entrance is still sealed, is it not?"#
2621 "It is. Why do you ask?"#
2622 "Nevermind. It's nothing."#

2623 "Is the Minotaur necessary, Brother?"#
2624 "No, sister, but I do like the show."#

2653 "Let them come."#

2640 "How much longer must I wait around?"#
2641 "Go about your business, Brother. There isn't much to prepare."#

2642 "You were right to exclude the rest of the guild from our plans here, Brother."#
2643 "Small minds always have small ambitions."#

# Endgame.
2644 "Our access to power has only increased since you removed Herx."#
2645 "Allow us to thank you for giving his Barony over to us."#

# Orpheus death.

 I tried to get into the Crystal Caves, but a barrier stopped me.#
2742 The %s
 Perhaps the Magicians’ Guild erected that barrier.#
2743 The %s
 I'm from a distant city and a member of the Hunters' Guild.#
2744 The %s
 Hamlet's Hunters' Guild isn't in this district.#
2745 The %s
 I guess Magicians and Hunters don't get along so well.#
2746 The %s
 Hunters kill bad guys. Sometimes they're Magicians.#
2747 The %s
 No grudges, just don't be a bad guy!#

 Is it strange that I am tempted to go back into the mine?#
2752 The %s
 The sky out here is so large. I'm scared.#
2753 The %s
 The mines, Herx's dungeon, is on the other side of this gate.#
2754 The %s
 Maybe I'll just go back for a little while.#

2760 type:seq#
2761 The %s
 The Magicians' Guild must be up to something.#
2762 The %s
 Guilds always have too many secrets.#
2763 The %s
 I heard that Merlin and the Magicians' Guild had a falling out.#
2764 The %s
 I bet Herx is in tight with Archmagisters Orpheus and Erudyce.#
2765 The %s
 Don't get me started on the Hunters' Guild.#
2766 The %s
 I heard the Masons' Guild works for the Church.#
2767 The %s
 The Church has secrets, but they also help the poor.#
2768 The %s
 Is the Church a Guild? Asking for a friend.#

2771 The %s
 Welcome back, %s. I hope you're rested.#
2772 The %s
 The magicians inside can explain everything.#
2773 The %s
 Me? No, I'm just a doorman.#
2774 The %s
 Many come and go, %s. No membership required.#
2775 The %s
 Merlin used to come by a lot, but then he just stopped.#
2776 The %s
 Come to think of it, Herx used to come by regularly.#
2777 The %s
 Herx would always leave angry after every visit.#
2778 The %s
 I wish I could've seen Herx's face when you showed up...#

2780 type:seq#
2781 The %s
 The Baron wanted to set up the mine in the Crystal Caves.#
2782 The %s
 The Archmagisters refused to allow Herx to mine there.#
2783 The %s
 Herx offered a lot of grants to the Magicians' Guild.#
2784 The %s
 I think Herx expected favors from the Archmagisters.#
2785 The %s
 Eventually, Herx gave up on getting the help of the Guild.#
2786 The %s
 Things turned out bad, but they could've been worse.#
2787 The %s

 Merlin told us about the dangerous magic Herx found.#
2792 The %s
 We never heard from Merlin again after he left to stop Herx.#
2793 The %s
 I heard rumors about a new letter from Merlin, but I never saw it.#
2794 The %s
 You know, Merlin was never an official member of the Magicians’ Guild.#
2795 The %s
 Some people just need their independence. I respect that.#

2800 type:seq#
2801 The %s
 After Herx was locked away, the Archmagisters went to the Crystal Caves.#
2802 The %s
 I guess they wanted to see what all the fuss was about.#
2803 The %s
 If it wasn't for the Archmagisters, Herx would've built an army here.#
2804 The %s
 We never would've been able to figure out how to lock Herx away. #
2805 The %s
 I think Erudyce and Orpheus knew sealing up Herx wouldn't be enough.#
2806 The %s
 ...#

2810 type:seq#
2811 The %s
 Powerful monsters started coming from the Crystal Caves.#
2812 The %s
 The Guild had to seal the Caves to keep Hamlet from being destroyed.#
2813 The %s
 I hope that the Archmagisters inside are alright.#
2814 The %s
 I really hope those monsters have nothing to do with their research.#

 Orpheus is so driven. Nothing can stop him.#

 I sensed power from the orb when you put it on that pedestal.#
2822 The %s
 I wonder why Herx didn't use that power to escape the dungeon.#
2823 The %s
 I was able to trap some of the power that Herx's orb released.#
2824 The %s
 This portal pierces the seal to the Caves using the power of the orb.#
2825 The %s
 Archmagisters Orpheus and Erudyce will help return things to normal.#
2826 The %s
 They must have learned something about the power Herx found.#

 Don't worry %s, I know who you are.#
2832 %s
 I wanted to meet you before you left town.#
2833 %s
 Me? I am one of the esteemed members of the Merchants' Guild.#
2834 %s
 I'm only interested in the rarest of
 artifacts in the land.              
 In particular, the Magician's orbs that were stolen by Herx.#
2835 %s
 If you happened to retrieve any of 
 them, I'd be willing to part with one of my prized possessions in return.#
2836 %s
 You see, a high ranking guild member
 such as myself can extort those mages 
 for every penny they own with their 
 precious orbs!#
2837 %s
 I know you have too much of a heart to do the same yourself.#
2838 %s
 So it is up to you.                
 Leave them with me, and we'll say no 
 more about our little encounter.#
