You will need the following libraries to build Barony:

 * FMOD Ex - downloadable at http://www.fmod.org/download-previous-products/ (you do need an account to download it)
 * libpng
 * SDL2
 * SDL2_image
 * SDL2_net
 * SDL2_ttf

You will also need the following tools:

 * A working C++ compiler (Visual Studio 2013/2015, MinGW, GCC, or xtools)
 * CMake (Windows optional)

If you're using Visual Studio, simply open the relevant project file, configure the library and include paths for each project, and build the whole solution to generate the .exe files.

If you're using MinGW or GCC, you'll need to run CMake first, then make.

Keep in mind that there are a lot of references to Steamworks in the code. They should all be #ifdef'd out, but if you get any linker errors about Steamworks, make sure STEAMWORKS is undef'd in main.hpp and try again.
