Modification of the Barony source, includes [this C++ json library](https://github.com/nlohmann/json). This modification is specifcally to make Barony more moddable and to fix flaws I see in the source code. [Checkout the original fork](https://github.com/TurningWheel/Barony) before looking at this.

After building drop the classes.json in the barony steam folder and you're good to go.

Classes can be made using [this tool](https://www.jasonbeetham.com/barony).
